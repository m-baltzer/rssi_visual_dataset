# rssi_visual_dataset
## Summary
This is a dataset with visual data from a monocular camera and WiFi RSSI measurements. The purpose is to provide data for the development and testing of V-SLAM systems augmented with WiFi fingerprinting. This dataset could be used in other localization systems which wish to use a fusion of visual and WiFi sensors.

See the references for more information on using WiFi in SLAM systems.
